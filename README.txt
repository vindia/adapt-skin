Built May 2014, starting with source from:
http://purecss.io/layouts/side-menu/
The hard part was done by the YUI and Normalise.js developers.

This skin's page on PmWiki.org:
http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/Skins/Adapt
The CMS Mode recipe works well with this skin:
http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/CMSMode

Install by copying the directory to pub/skins/ and putting
this in your config.php configuration file:

   ## Use the Adapt Skin
   $Skin = 'adapt';

Enjoy.
